This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)
copied from Ryan Solomon's [project](https://github.com/coderyansolomon/cypress-course) to practise Cypress.js.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Running Cypress Tests

To run the tests, start Cypress in separate terminal:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

Then follow Cypress browser steps for either E2E or Component Testing.
